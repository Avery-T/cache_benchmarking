## Program Description

The purpose of this program is to detect the cache usage and structure on various x86 processors.
The structure of every x86 processor advances every generation and as the result, the layout of the caches vary.
This program aims to use memory allocation and determine the size of the caches and calculate memory access times (L1, L2, RAM, and SSD).
